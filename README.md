The study that have done based on the survey data presented in Consumer Finanacial Protection Bureau's 2017 National Financial Well being survey. <br/>
What I have found in my study is that financial literacy is a better predictor of financial well being compared to income. <br/>
What this means is that if we wanted to start a new program that would be targeted at improving the financial well-being we can focus on improving financial literacy and not just focus on income. <br/>
There are plenty of reasons why we may want to develop programs that focus on improving financial well-being. <br/>
Financial well-being is not easy to define, and it often means diiferent things for different people, but at it's core financial well-being represents how satisfied a person is in making financial decisions. <br/>
For a large portion of the population, finances are a major source of  stress. We do not have to look at the studies to understand this, just remember the last time you, or someone that you know had been under stress which was caused by finances. <br/>
Financial literacy in this case helps us remove stress from our lives by helping us get a better understanding of some of the key financial concepts and helps us make better financial decisions. <br/>
Below is an example of how financial literacy helps people in more ways than one. <br.>
Think about credit cards, for example. Credit cards are readily available and are one of the worst ways to get a loan when we need one. <br/>
Unlike usual loans at the bank, credit card loans are very expensive, with interest rates up to 25%. <br/>
In the US an average household has 5,700$ in credit card debt. It is easy to spend more than you have on your credit card. It is there, you don't have to go to the bank and apply for a long, you just need something and instantly you can buy it. <br/>
So we take the easy option, not wanting to go to a bank and having to go through a lenghtly process of getting a loan and we take a credit card loan.<br/>
But now we are stuck paying an interest rate twice, if not three times higher than had we gone to the bank. <br/>
Higer payments means that our future income is lowered, causing us to have stress because we were really hoping to use future income for our bills, food, vacation etc.<br/>
Even worse, because we have more debt than we would have had we gone to the bank, we cannot get more debt in case of an emergency. <br/>
The fear of not being prepared in case something happens, causes us even more stress. <br/>
Financial literacy is the knowledge of knowing not to take credit card loans, or if we have it how to best refinance it so that we are not stuck in a position of high stress and being worried about the future. <br/>
Better still is that by understanding how the financial world works, we are more comfotable in our decisions. <br/>
Finacial literacy helped us lower us stress level and increased our financial well-being. <br/>
Now, you might be thinking, that this is an extreme situation, not everybody that takes credit card debt owes so much money that it causees them stress. <br/>
True, not everyone goes in large debt this way. But let's assume that one in 10 people with credit card debt owe enough money to cause them stress. <br/>
With 120 million people in credit card debt in the USA, we have 12 million people whose health is lowered because of the stress caused by the credit card debt. <br/>
This is just one example, and there are many different ways of getting into unfavorable debt, and even more ways that we are not getting as much on our savings. <br/>
Financial literacy is there to help us understand where to look for loans and where to put our money. <br/>
For those in position where they can do something to help the people tackle the problem of low financial well-being, this study shows that there are more thing that play a part into how confident a person feels about their finances, not just their income. <br/>
