The study that have done based on the survey data presented in Consumer Finanacial Protection Bureau's 2017 National Financial Well being survey <br/>
What I have found in my study is that financial literacy is a better predictor of financial well being compared to income <br/>
What this means is that if we wanted to start a new program that would be targeted at improving the financial well-being we can focus on improving financial literacy and not just focus on income<br/>
